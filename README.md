# flight_processer
A Python project describing a computer acting as a processor for a flight controller Arduino connected through serial. The computer is intended to calculate motor instructions from the Arduino based on 9dof IMU, coming in through the Arduino and image data, coming in through a camera attached to the computer. It is intended to use a physics-informed nn approach.
